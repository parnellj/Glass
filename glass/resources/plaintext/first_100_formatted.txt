Valentine week, 1850
Awake ye muses nine, sing me a strain divine,
Unwind the solemn twine, and tie my Valentine!

Oh the Earth was made for lovers, for damsel, and hopeless swain,
For sighing, and gentle whispering, and unity made of twain.
All things do go a courting, in earth, or sea, or air,
God hath made nothing single but thee in His world so fair!
The brick, and then the bridegroom, the two, and then the one,
Adam, and Eve, his consort, the .moon, and then the sun;
The life doth prove the precept, who obey shall happy be,
Who will not serve the sovereign, be hanged on fatal tree.
The high do seek the lowly, the great do seek the small,
None cannot find who seeketh, on this terrestrial ball;
The bee doth court the flower, the Hower his suit receives,
And they make merry wedding, whose guests are hundred leaves;
The wind doth woo the branches, the branches they are won,
And the father fond demandeth the maiden for his son.
The storm doth walk the seashore humming a mournful tune,
The wave with eye so pensive, looketh to see the moon,
Their spirits meet together, they make them solemn vows,
No more he singeth mournful, her sadness she doth lose.
The worm doth woo the mortal, death claims a living bride,
Night unto day is married, morn unto eventide;
Earth is a merry damsel, and heaven a knight so true,
And Earth is quite coquettish, and beseemeth in vain to sue.
Now to the application, to the reading of the roll,
To bringing thee to justice, and marshalling thy soul :
Thou art a human solo, a being cold, and lone,
Wilt have no kind companion, thou reap' st what thou hast sown.
Hast never silent hours, and minutes all too long,
And a deal of sad reflection, and wailing instead of song?
There's Sarah, and Eliza, and Emeline so fair,
And Harriet, and Susan, and she with curling hair!
Thine eyes are sadly blinded, but yet thou mayest see
Six true, and comely maidens sitting upon the tree;
Approach that tree with caution, then up it boldly climb,
And seize the one thou. lovest, nor care for space, or time!
Then bear her to the greenwood, and build for her a bower,
And give her what she asketh, jewel, or bird, or flower -
And bring the fife, and trumpet, and beat upon the drum
And bid the world Goodmorrow, and go to glory ho

There is another sky,
Ever serene and fair,
And there is another sunshine,
Though it be darkness there;
Never mind faded forests, Austin,
Never mind silent fields -
Here is a litde forest,
Whose leaf is ever green;
Here is a brighter garden,
Where not a frost has been;
In its unfading flowers
I hear the bright bee hum;
Prithee, my brother,
Into my garden come!

"Sic transit gloria mundi,"
"How doth the busy bee,"
"Dum vivimus vivamus,"
I stay mine enemy!
Oh "veni, vidi, vici!"
Oh caput cap-a-pie!
And oh "memento mori"
	When I am far from thee!
	
Hurrah for Peter Parley!
	Hurrah for Daniel Boone!
Three cheers, sir, for the gentleman
	Who first observed the moon!

Peter, put up the sunshine;
	Patti, arrange the stars;
Tell Luna, tea is waiting,
	And call your brother Mars!

Put down the apple, Adam,
	And come away with me,
So shalt thou have a pippin
	From off my father's tree!


I climb the "Hill of Science,"
	I "view the landscape o'er;"
Such transcendental prospect,
	I ne'er beheld before!

Unto the Legislature
	My country bids me go;
I'll take my india rubbers,
	In case the wind should blow!
	
During my education,
	It was announced to me
That gravitation, stumbling,
	Fell from an apple tree!

The earth upon an axis
	Was once supposed to turn,
By way of a gymnastic
	In honor of the sun!

It was the brave Columbus,
	A sailing o'er the tide,
Who notified the nations
	Of where I would reside!

Mortality is fatal -
Gentility is fine,
Rascality, heroic,
Insolvency, sublime!

Our Fathers heing weary,
Laid down on Bunker Hill;
And tho' full many a morning,
Yet they are sleeping still, -

The trumpet, sir, shall wake them,
In dreams I see them rise,
Each with a solemn musket
A marching to the skies!

A coward will remain, Sir,
Until the fight is done;
But an immortal hero
Will take his hat, and run!

Good hye, Sir, I am going;
My country calleth me;
Allow me, Sir, at parting,
To wipe my weeping e'e.
In token of our friendship

Accept this "Bonnie Doon,"
And when the hand that plucked i
Hath passed beyond the moon,

The memory of my ashes
Will consolation be;
Then, farewell, Tuscarora,
And farewell, Sir, to thee!

On this wondrous sea
Sailing silently,
Ho! Pilot, ho!

Knowest thou the shore
Where no breakers roar -
Where the storm is o'er?

In the peaceful west
Many the sails at rest -
The anchors fast -
Thither I pilot thee -
Land Ho! Eternity!
Ashore at last!

I have a Bird in spring
Which for myself doth sing -
The spring decoys.
And as the summer nears -
And as the Rose appears,
Robin is gone.

Yet do I not repine
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown -
Learneth beyond the sea
Melody new for me
And will return.

Fast in a safer hand
Held in a truer Land
Are mine -
And though they now depart,
Tell I my doubting heart
They're thine.

In a serener Bright,
In a more golden light
I see
Each little doubt and fear,
Each little discord here
Removed.

Then will I not repine,
Knowing that Bird of mine
Though flown
Shall in a distant tree
Bright melody for me
Return.

Frequently the woods are pink -
Frequently are brown.
Frequently the hills undress
Behind my native town.
Oft a head is crested

And as oft a cranny
Where it used to he -
And the Earth -

On its Axis turned!
Wonderful Rotation!

The feet of people walking home
With gayer sandals go -
The Crocus - till she rises
The Vassal of the snow -
The lips at Hallelujah
Long years of practise bore
Till bye and bye these Bargemen
Walked singing on the shore.

Pearls are the Diver's farthings
Extorted from the Sea -
Pinions - the Seraph's wagon
Pedestrian once - as we -
Night is the morning's Canvas
Larceny - legacy -
Death, but our rapt attention
To Immortality.

My figures fail to tell me
How far the Village lies Whose
peasants are the Angels -
Whose Cantons dot the skies -
My Classics veil their faces -
My faith that Dark adores -
Which from its solemn abbeys
Such resurrection pours.

Which bears a sword
Can pierce an armed man -

And is mute again -
But where it fell

On patriotic day,
Some epauletted Brother
Oave his breath away.
Wherever runs the breathless sun -
Wherever roams the day -
There is its noiseless onset -
There is its victory!
Behold the keenest marksman!
The most accomplished shot!
Time's sublimest target
Is a soul "forgot!"

Through lane it lay - through bramble
Through clearing and through wood -
Banditti often passed us
Upon the lonely road.

The wolf came peering curious -
The owl looked puzzled down -
The serpent's satin figure
Glid stealthily along -

The tempests touched our garments -
The lightning's poinards gleamed -
Fierce from the Crag above us
The hungry Vulture screamed -
The satyr's fingers beckoned -
The valley murmured "Come" -
These were the mates -
This was the road
These children fluttered home.

My wheel is in the dark!
I cannot see a spoke
Yet know its dripping feet
Go round and round.
My foot is on the Tide!
An unfrequented road -
Yet have all roads
A clearing at the end -

Some have resigned the Loom -
Some in the busy tomb
Find quaint employ -

Some with new - stately feet -
Pass royal through the gate -
Flinging the problem back
At you and I!

I never told the buried gold
Upon the hill - that lies -
I saw the sun - his plunder done
Crouch low to guard his prize.

He stood as near
As stood you here -
A pace had been between -
Did but a snake bisect the brake
My life had forfeit been.

That was a wondrous booty -
I hope 'twas honest gained.
Those were the fairest ingots
That ever kissed the spade!

Whether to keep the secret -
Whether to reveal -
Whether as I ponder
Kidd will sudden sail -

Could a shrewd advise me
We might e'en divide -
Should a shrewd betray me -
Atropos decide!

I'll put a trinket on.

Sleep is suppased to be
By souls of sanity
The shutting of the eye.

Sleep is the station grand
Down which, on either hand
The hosts of witness stand!

Morn is supposed to be
By people of degree
The breaking of the Day.

Morning has not occurred!

That shall Aurora be -
East of Eternity -
One with the banner gay -
One in the red array -
That is the break of Day!

One Sister have I in our house,
And one, a hedge away.
There's only one recorded,
But both belong to me.

One came the road that I came -
And wore my last year's gown -
The other, as a bird her nest,
Builded our hearts among.

She did not sing as we did -
It was a different tune -
Herself to her a music
As Bumble bee of June.

Today is far from Childhood -
But up and down the hills
I held her hand the tighter -
Which shortened all the miles -

And still her hum
The years among,
Deceives the Butterfly;
Still in her Eye
The Violets lie
Mouldered this many May.

I spilt the dew -
But took the morn -
I chose this single star
From out the wide night's numbers -
Sue - forevermore!

Of Ermine is his doublet -

Or the Lapwing's shore!

The Gentian weaves her fringes -
The Maple's loom is red -
My departing blossoms
Obviate parade.

A brief, but patient illness -
An hour to prepare,
And one below this morning
Is where the angels are -
It was a short procession,
The Bobolink was there -
An aged Bee addressed us -
And then we knelt in prayer -
We trust that she was willing -
We ask that we may be.
Summer - Sister - Seraph!
Let us go with thee!

In the name of the Bee -
And of the Butterfly -
And of the Breeze - Amen!

I shall not feel the sleet - then -
I shall not fear the snow.

Flees so the phantom meadow

So bubble brooks in deserts
On Ears that dying lie -
Bum so the Evening Spires
To Eyes that Closing go
Hangs so distant Heaven -
To a hand below.

Then sleeps in state again -
My chancel - all the plain

To lose - if one can find again -
To miss - if one shall me et -
The Burglar cannot rob - then -
The Broker cannot cheat.
So build the hillocks gaily
Thou little spade of mine
Leaving nooks for Daisy

To him who keeps an Orchis' heart -
The swamps are pink with June.

I had a guinea golden -
I lost it in the sand -
And th o' the sum was simple
And pounds were in the land -
Still, had it such a value
Unto my frugal eye -
That when I could not find it -
I sat me down to sigh.

I had a crimson Robin -
Who sang full many a day
But when the wo ods were painted,
He, too, did fly away -
Time brought me other Robins -
Their ballads were the same -
Still, for my missing Troubadour
I kept the "house at hame."

I had a star in heaven -
One "Pleiad" was its name -
And when I was not heeding,
It wandered from the same.
And tho' the skies are crowded -
And all the night ashine -
I do not care about it -
Since none of them are mine.

My story has a moral -
I have a missing friend -
"Pleiad" its name, and Robin,
And guinea in the sand.
And when this mournful ditty
Accompanied with tear -
Shall meet the eye of traitor
In country far from here -
Grant that repentance solemn
May seize upon his mind -
And he no consolation
Beneath the sun may find.

There is a morn by men unseen -
Whose maids upon remoter green
Keep their Seraphic May -
And all day long, with dance and game,
And gambol I may never name -
Employ their holiday.

Here to light measure, move the feet
Which walk no more the village street -
Nor by the wood are found -
Here are the birds that sought the sun
When last year's distaff idle hung
And summer's brows were bound.

Ne'er saw I such a wondrous scene -
Ne'er such a ring on such a green -
Nor so serene array -
As if the stars some summer night
Should swing their cups of Chrysolite
And revel till the day -

Like thee to dance - like thee to sing -
People upon the mystic green -
I ask, each new May Morn.
I wait thy far, fantastic bells -
Announcing me in other dells -
Unto the different dawn!

That one so shy - so ignorant
Should have the face to die.

The hillsides must not know it -

Nor heedless by the way
Hint that within the Riddle
One will walk today -

When going home from school -
And wondered what they did there -
And why it was so still -

I did not know the year then -
In which my call would come -
Earlier, by the Dial,
Than the rest have gone.

It's stiller than the sundown.
It's cooler than the dawn -
The Daisies dare to come here -
And birds can flutter down -

So when you are tired -
Or perplexed - or cold -
Trust the loving promise
Underneath the mould,
Cry "it's I," "take Dollie,"
And I will enfold!

Which blossom in the dark.

If I should cease to bring a Rose
Upon a festal day,
'Twill be because beyond the Rose
I have been called away -

If I should cease to take the names
My buds commemorate -
'Twill be because Death's finger
Claps my murmuring lip!

Delayed till she had ceased to know - 
Delayed till in its vest of snow 
Her loving bosom lay -
An hour behind the fleeting breath -
Later by just an hour than Death -
Oh lagging Yesterday!

Could she have guessed that it would be -
Could but a crier of the joy
Have climbed the distant hill -
Had not the bliss so slow a pace
Who knows hut this surrendered face
Were undefeated still?

Oh if there may departing be
Any forgot hy Victory
In her imperial round -
Show them this meek appareled thing
That could not stop to be a king -
Doubtful if it be crowned!

A little East of Jordan,
Evangelists record,
A Gymnast and an Angel
Did wrestle long and hard -

Till morning touching mountain -
And Jacob, waxing strong,
The Angel begged permission
To Breakfast - to return -

Not so, said cunning Jacob!
"I will not let thee go
Except thou bless me" - Stranger!
The which acceded to -

Light swung the silver fleeces
"Peniel" Hills beyond,
And the bewildered Gymnast
Found he had worsted God!

In their Chapeaux of fire,

Not found,

Argues the Aster still -
Reasons the Daffodil

Some Vision of the World Cashmere -

Or else a Peacock's purple Train
Feather by feather - on the plain
Fritters itself away!

The dreamy Butterflies bestir!
Lethargic pools resume the whir
Of last year's sundered tune!
From some old Fortress on the sun
Baronial Bees - march - one by one -
In murmuring platoon!

The Robins stand as thick today
As flakes of snow stood yesterday -
On fence - and Roof - and Twig!
The Orchis binds her feather on
For her old lover - Don the Sun!
Revisiting the Bog!

Without Commander! Countless! Still!

In bright detachment stand!
Behold! Whose Multitudes are these?
The children of whose turbaned seas -
Or what Circassian Land?

Nor can you tell me -
Saints, with ravished slate and pencil
Solve our April Day!

Sweeter than a vanished frolic
From a vanished green{
Swifter than the hoofs of Horsemen
Round a Ledge of dream!

Modest, let us walk among it
With our faces veiled -
As they say polite Archangels
Do in meeting God!

Not for me - to prate about it!

"Charming April Day"!

To sublimer Recitation
Are prepared to go!

"Arcturus" is his other name - 
I'd rather call him "Star." 
It's very mean of Science 
To go and interfere!

I slew a worm the other day - 
A "Savant" passing by 
Murmured "Resurgam" - "Centipede"!
"Oh Lord - how frail are we"!

I pull a flower from the woods -
A monster with a glass
Computes the stamens in a breath
And has her in a "class"!

Whereas I took the Butterfly
Aforetime in my hat -
He sits erect in "Cabinets" -
The Clover bells forgot.

What once was "Heaven"
Is "Zenith" now -
Where I proposed to go
When Time's brief masquerade was done
Is mapped and charted too.
What if the poles should frisk about
And stand upon their heads!
I hope I'm ready for "the worst" -
Whatever prank betides!

Perhaps the "Kingdom of Heaven's" changed -
I hope the "Children" there
Won't be "new fashioned" when I come
And laugh at me - and stare -

I hope the Father in the skies
Will lift his little girl -
Old fashioned - naughty - everything -
Over the stile of "Pearl."

Glowing is her Cheek,

Vanish unrecorded
Save by tearful rill -

Save by loving sunrise
Looking for her face.
Save by feet unnumbered
Pausing at the place.

Can such a foot explore
The purple territories
On Pizarro's shore?

Her annual secret keeps!
A Lady white, within the Field
In placid Lily sleeps!

The tidy Breezes, with their Brooms
Sweep vale - and hill - and tree!
Prithee, My pretty Housewives!
Who may expected be?

The Neighbors do not yet suspect!
The Woods exchange a smile!
Orchard, and Buttercup, and Bird -
In such a little while!

And yet, how still the Landscape stands!
How nonchalant the Hedge!
As if the "Resurrection"
Were nothing very strange!

Gambolled away
Her lease of spotted hours,
Then sank as gaily as a Turk
Upon a Couch of Rowers.

Her vestments as the silver Reece -
Her countenance as spray.

A poor - torn heart - a tattered heart
That sat it down to rest -
Nor noticed that the Ebbing Day
Flowed silver to the West -
Nor noticed Night did soft descend
Nor Constellation burn -
Intent upon the vision
Of latitudes unknown.

The angels - happening that way
This dusty heart espied -
Tenderly took it up from toil
And carried it to God -
There - sandals for the Barefoot -
There - gathered from the gales -
Do the blue havens by the hand
Lead the wandering Sails.

Pray do not ask me how!
Indeed I'm too astonished
To think of answering you!
Going to Heaven!
How dim it sounds!
And yet it will be done
As sure as flocks go home at night
Unto the Shepherd's arm!

Perhaps you're going too!
Who knows?
If you should get there first
Save just a little space for me
Close to the two I lost -
The smallest "Robe" will fit me
And just a bit of "Crown" -
For you know we do not mind our dress
When we are going home -

I'm glad I don't believe it
For it would stop my breath -
And I'd like to look a little more
At such a curious Earth!
I'm glad they did believe it
Whom I have never found
Since the mighty Autumn afternoon
I left them in the ground.

Except it quiet bring
Our little garden that we lost
Back to the Lawn again.

So spicy her Carnations nod -
So drunken, reel her Bees -
So silver steal a hundred flutes

That whoso sees this little flower
By faith may clear behold
The Bobolinks around the throne
And Dandelions gold.

What rosy face
Has lost a blush today?

Heart, not so heavy as mine
Wending late home -
As it passed my window
Whistled itself a tune -
A careless snatch - a ballad -
A ditty of the street -
Yet to my irritated Ear
An Anodyne so sweet -
It was as if a Bobolink
Sauntering this way
Carolled, and paused, and carolled -
Then bubbled slow away!
It was as if a chirping brook
Upon a dusty way -
Set bleeding feet to minuets
Without the knowing why!
Tomorrow, night will come again -
Perhaps, weary and sore -
Ah Bugle! By my window
I pray you pass once more.

I recollect it welll
Amid no bells nor bravoes
The bystanders will tell!
Cheerful - as to the village -
Tranquil - as to repose -
Chastened - as to the Chapel
This humble Tourist rose!
Did not talk of returning!
Alluded to no time
When, were the gales propitious
We might look for him!
Was grateful for the Roses
In life's diverse bouquet -
Talked softly of new species
To pick another day;
Beguiling thus the wonder
The wondrous nearer drew -
Hands bustled at the moorings -
The crowd respectful grew -
Ascended from our vision
To Countenances new!
A Difference - A Daisy -
Is all the rest I knew!

By which a single bone -

Of some rare tenant of the mold,
Else perished in the stone -

Upon a winter's day,
Stands representative in gold
Of Rose and Lily, manifold,
And countless Butterfly!
