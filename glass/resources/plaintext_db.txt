White milk and diamonds drip sweet from Her lips,
and shows of emerald peace shine from Her eyes;
my pan and loupe and pen are cargo ships
are ramshackle holds for her heavenly lays

You are a Janus! A god with two-faced truths!

Her mouth sounds loud and mute the song of smoke
and cigarettes; I'll transcribe every breath,
Her raving bigot tirades, slurs and hopes
a shotgun fury, blowing holes through death.

its stalks lean back under their bodies' coil

In savage shrill she sobs for it to stop
the storm and thunder deafen earth to her.
Her tears are mixed with hideous drips of

Winds, diminishes like an orange peel as it approaches the navel:
the ouroboric staircase of dialectic like an inverse cone
points like a plumb bob towards the arctic end of history.

Entropic, staved off by ranks of chessmen, by files of notes;
this passenger is scared of flying, that one is on Xanax,
another a sex tourist, carried by the jet stream, resisting time.

You can't stay up forever.  A mountain can't.  How can a plane?

To whether dreams have structure, 		I can't speak

one bug a furious trope that weaves 		around
digesting leaves, books, letters as 		it roams.

Salts which energize, depress, and		salts that sink.

Atoms, antiquarks, phases that 		matter, the

Making a slow and freezing space, and 	vast

Telling quick as tadpoles, 			slow like night.

Each body runs its circuit, like 		an hour
Rolling out a strand 				of icy thread.

Starwise periapsis, 				dry reunion

The same he saw when Dante 		felt the triune
Holding forth, was of the sky 			and before it,
Earth grazing his feet, 			heaven their crown.

Fire makes the day, but space lies 		cold, and
Lurches quiet, absolutely 			dark.
Opal, lucent, galaxies run 			dry
White flashes, headache, a seizure or 	fever
Elements that swim 				in sweeping waves
Reactive, radio, a stomach 			spasms.

Nothing signaled, nothing lost.  		The cosmos
Ease our way through dreams 		and eons long
Blinked through atmosphere, and		hyperopic
Undiluted, clean 				but also sterile.
Landfall necessity, 				but not before
At crashing angles, 				the nebula arcs in.

What growth there was was not 		in dendrites formed

a resonant frequency to dredge,		to break
to find within the depths gold ore,		or sin
then fill me in irradiate 			an ache
if light rays could escape			from a black hole

You break these careful symmetries, these walls
indelicate, just like I'd never left.
There is no metaphor for you, just hate.
Remember in the bathroom where I retched
because you made me cry and hit the walls
and hit myself and hit the door, and scream
into my pillow while you fed me drugs
and all I did was snort, and smoke, and drink,
and eat.   I was a human garbage can
you said, and laughed, a funny phrase to hide
your teeth.  You sitting there, creaking the couch,
nursing my deaf brother, watching TV,
you bought my time with drugs.  You knew, you
played that you were weak, your autoimmune
disorder, your stomach, your joints, but you
could yell and shake the house and call me shit
and glare, and beat my sister, beat the dog,
And when you die, I won't be there, I hope
arthritis racks your body, that you're blind,
that your own cells destroy you, unimmune,
and in your death remember what you did.
You had a word for everything, but now
I have the words.  You're too frail for your craft
you can't melt glass, you can't bend wire, you
can't hold scissors any more.  Your beads and gems
I'll throw away, your opal ring, your wedding ring
I'll smelt and sell for cash.  I'll burn your
pictures, memories, and keepsakes.
You made me ugly, these words have no tune,
at first I lived in you, then with you, now
I sound the night to find my echoing call
which comes back refracted, black and shattered,
your eyes you said were hazel, but just as
obsidian is born from magma, which
in photos shows a deep and dying red
in clayey chunks around the warping hills,
the ashen trees, and burnt up vaporous leaves,
so your eyes were always glowering, dying
and dark in photographs but deadly hot.
What did the Sibyl say?  I want you to die

When Philomela couldn't speak, 		she wove
In purple and in white the crime 		she bore

Whether the tapestry had words, 		or signs

Harder to tell by words than by a thread
when each line ends after five stitches sewn
you tie the new one to the old, but lose
the sense you had before.  I try to keep
it straight, the way I fled, and came around.

But they would always interrupt 		my thoughts
and shaking I rethreaded 			retreating

here were my escapes, white noise		whispering
at first, and later shouting never		whole

I also lack a tongue.  There also is
a violent story here.  I vacillate
between each end, and shuttle towards a truth;

	My dreams were shadowboxed, assemblage in blue and black.

The blasts broke buildings.  The corpus ash.  The corridor is dust.
	The coronae poured thousands of rems upon my head.

Each new curve in the topography of technology cuts down into the Earth in me,

How can I impugn the scalpel that sculpts me?  Easily, when I see the blood from twenty 	thousand other surgeries infecting countries around me.

Surgeries were what killed me.  You all are what kills me.  I, I guess, will kill me.

Editor's note:  The holograph for this verse was discovered quite by accident, tucked in an edition of Medieval and Roman love poetry.  Attempts to source the prefatory remarks, epigraph, & body (all of which are in distinct or cleverly disguised hands) have proven quite unsuccessful---which leaves this editor to ponder the contents of the poet's earlier, "jest"ing work and the identity of his "Corinna."					(Anonymous Lyrics, pp. 177-78)


	The author, having been accused of excessive jest, of swaying so far back to dodge that he falls out of the ring---and a myriad of lesser sins---will here endeavour to answer his accuser with an agonisingly earnest song.

"...I have forgotten how to pollinate
myself for rebirth"
---Corinna

Through my lungs & skull & stomach,
	the nerves spark in fear, in ecstasies
			           & in my knees.

What thrills me, what fears me?
	That I with you am always breathing in,
			        always praying;
	That nature hates this constancy;
	That I feel, for once, good trembling.

I think these fears will always come
	as our thrills & rainstorms do.
It is the best I can think for us
	to be gardeners & shepherds
	guiding & feeding the other for
the fear I hope------no,
the fear I know will never come.

Breathe in as I breathe out
	out as I in---
The circuit closed, the voltage
	shocks dead Fear.

TX  - Lepidoptery, or butterflies' ascent
and deaths and drifts can teach us each a lesson.
When some one asks how long you guess they gestate,
say "from when the eggs are laid, 'till gorgeous
singing wings from every color palette
hatch," and catch themselves on their descent.

Whereas the Monarch's wings ring out dissent
and sifting pollen, fallen flowers assent
to be tasted; "it touches my palate
to drum" (like Ringo) "up food." In lessen-
ing light the bats' flight; mostly on moths gorge---
greed feeding, in their house not one guest ate.

All, recall my first papilon who I guess ate
out my mother's flowers, and the scent
of dew. I thought I caught it sitting, George is
the quiet one, pinned the finned wings, a scent:
she said, "it spreads allergens, the less sin
in killing, spilling on the driftwood pallet."

The eve of autumn shaking ice, pa let
them go to row the freezing sky, I guessed eight
or nine of mine fanned out; fled, he said, "less sun
by the day, son."  A dirt-filled rift, this ant
crawled out, was trapped, let go, I left, as sent,
being bored with the bugs, to play at George's
at a time when in China the Three Gorges
Damns shift environs, voltage, like Paul it
sang.  Struck, no luck, ambassadors a-sent
abroad got got, in America jest ate
our frowns, I knew what newsmen meant ("the sent
aid stayed not a lot, more out, less in")

Who put more store with whirling woe and less on
lepidopterae within their gorge is
a delicate biome home and the cent-
ury short shrifted me with walled wars' pall it
is as he said "it sinned when it just ate
by pistils filled it couldn't fly worth a cent."

"By ascent I meant confession, not lesson,
late to gestate. John's songs were the gorgeous
Fire-lit palette, my drifting swift descent."

PT  -
TX  - The proceeding verses offer as their subject certain actual moments; in this way they may be called confessional.  The ground I seek is not a common shame or darkness but the light times; where our human systems of approximation most fall away and reveal the white bones.  Where the mind, being aware both of the absurdity of the moment and its undeniable force, jettisons both responses and enters a brief state of pure being.

If I had done this before, I cannot remember; this is the point---these are the experiences with my developing emotional core, a baggage that the storms of time have dropped on my little island.  Years go by until I can see them, and when I flip them open, rifling greedily through, I find these scraps of paper and slight missives.

They are in the language of music and photographs; the mental pictures I shot and at that time, narrated.  For I'm nothing if not a jabbermouth.  But now: the older scenes are dimmer, often still & shimmer around the borders.  I feel pools, the heat coming off the white concrete---but no, I'll spoil the surprise!

I cannot catch one now, these butterflies, gems flapping around near the grass---for this metaphor, too, is what they are.  But if I sit on my deck chair, watching the sun go down below the hospital we lived across from, maybe I'll see some, and fireflies, too.

I walked down the swooping sidewalk with the seaside shacks preludes to mansions
the mountains treed over and with a deep gash, tree-filled that you could walk in.

On my bike my feet chk-chk'ed on the concrete
I looked up, and was lifted over my eyes to see a field
Rising up
the hill with wheat, or golden grass.
It looked beautiful, looked taller than the mountain did then, no, taller still!

None of which I cared about.

The ballad of that old, wet man is still unenviable.  Indeed, the very sight of it makes me feel cold raindrops in my mouth.

Before I knew what it meant, I knew it meant what I was seeing
movie or dodgeball during recess;
windows crying rest of the day;
the hill & playground darkened like I'd never seen themselves
and waiting for dad in the prickling rain.

How it could rain!  The warmth of the droplet, splashing down often on my arms,
Freezing my scalp if I pushed my hair down;
and I walked, walked till I soaked it up
the feeling that nobody's near me in the mist and the rain;

I revisited this trope often in later days
it has become a leitmotif in my song, said or not,
summed up, I guess you could say, the rain follows me, or
I look for it.

"My angle?
You wanna know my angle?"
I was planning to steal the Hope Diamond,
was my angle,
a damn fine angle,
I'd say.
So I say,
"so there's my angle;
you like the plot?"
A simple plot.

In my plot
I found an angle
Of attack on the plot
Chart, on the plot
Right in front of me; I cross
Out the old plot
And plot
New ones in a diamond
Around the Diamond.
A scatter-plot
with a cross
over the cross,

which, I'd say
was the focus of the plot---
at the door I say,
"say,
how should I angle
this rope?" Later I'll say,
"say,
there's the cross
here on the plan, see the cross?"
He'll say
"on the ground, see the diamond?
We're on top of the Diamond!"
Long story short, we got the diamond.
I think I heard him say,
"what a huge diamond!
How will we fence the diamond?"
The flaw in our plot
(not in the diamond):
I say, "This diamond,
there's gotta be an angle,
some crazy angle
to buy the diamond."
We were at a cross.
My partner was cross.

I was cross.
All that work for the diamond,
a crystal cross,
all we had to cross
to get it, I can't even say.
We didn't cross
each other, no double-cross---
a simple plot
no counter-plot,
another score to cross
off our list.  A new angle,
maybe, a smarter angle.

No fancy angle,
a failed plot---
I guess you could say
that the Diamond
was my cross.

peak phosphorus, uranium, and iron.

The planets' axial tilts, the open flower,
illimitable views of God itself---
but all these and yourself you'd best forget.
The sphere becomes incontinent, it shits
itself, no atmosphere, no soil, no rain.
No foundries, telescopes or homes, no state,
the eggshell holds no food.

No power, refuse,
no silk to sew a tie, a fearless leader
cries, the broadcast cuts, the satellites
set for Venus or the sun; and nothing
knits the world together, no politics,
no mother.

I know just where I fit in this,
a leech, a bitch.  I sucked the tits although
the cow was dead, although the maggots crawled
onto my lips and down my throat, until
the milk was pus.  I suck.  You are not shit
until you jack your plug, the dick, into

make room in its wounds. Take.

	In rainbows' negatives; its lancing smell.

Hither and thither its cylinders wither my will;

	alloys, pistons & carbonized steel will
	motor on and gather more
food to run, run to food, what more?

How every eye is watching how it goes!

Except its self sustains: its engine groaned
	And sputtered and spewed a livid dying flame.
	This engine always runs.  She has no name.
		Everyone is judging my machine
	How she compares to billions of the same
		Worms which shall never turn, despair, who's clean,
And where can I take her to kill her and be unseen?

I did it.  I wrenched out that thing's wires, its guts, with a crowbar I smashed it,
and finally I set a fire right underneath its fuel tank.
The pilot light in its pipes is nothing, it hardly burns at all!
What was needed were weapons and wood, which I lugged to the spot,
accelerants to trash the rusted chassis, I expected not to be able to run anymore.

Nobody saw me on the shoulder;

is where I start; and stop.  Lighting my way
hoping in the flashes someone sees---You
with yours are higher; your pen stabs in
to you, body-full and conscious crystal;
pulls out turning hues and singing
forth, chromatically.  The point now body-
wise, as the stalk fills up the flower
till it bloom in the rosy springtime,
looks, ideas petals orange-flecked and pistils.

But flowers aren't you sublimed past
metaphor & image---just essences, abstracts
scribbled margin notes to your figure:
ascending, empyrean, glassine---transparent soul
silver & gold handmaidens, the elements your tools---------

I bend back as I go, O body unconstrained
by any-test line.

Deja vu again: have asked before, been rebuffed?
Or joyous day admitted into thoughts
of yours, hence mine: the star-tree fruit ripens
sweet and falls.  And I would snatch and
suck them dripping seeds, down to the rind
of sweetest knowing.

The ending ache of waiting all remains

your assent: to go then, you and I

together greater far than one, and arcing

Then in twilight dark brown faces stop the way

	were rough and unused to our holy heights
of laser sights and unmanned artillery.
Yet dumb and still as sand in foxhole dugs
	we sat and waited for orders to embark.

A gun for a prayer, I'm alone in the ground at dark,
	counting the minutes by each mortar's 'thud',
	and sweating from fear when the white flame arced.
The sky, my eyes, both red from flames and blood,
and pain------!
	They took me unconscious on a stretcher low.

In the sandlight again, one thousand days to go

you will fight no more. Unmanned, I hear alarms

Striated plains of Norwegian-Arctic snow, clean bite of December,

My mind no longer will stow away more prejudices, more hate; no more will it close itself off, it will have fixed the last shutter, shuddering blind and the only way I could close the window was with tin foil.

If my mind is a room, where is the house?  Is this simply a shanty, no running water no light; where is my half-bath, or my crenelated battlements from which to lob fiery arrows?  I didn't choose where to break ground here, I am more than a quarter through the construction and I doubt the mud and bones beneath the floor.  Is it a dirt floor or paneled?  What stains are on the carpets?  Can I sustain another winter here without the whole thing breaking up?

I am torn in each direction equally!
	Puns are come on <to> me,
But cleaning up their mess makes me choke,

I disavow all levity

Then let me ramble on, as I rack myself for facts, such as how I rack myself and torture cats 	because the west and patriarchy make me---though I'd say this more subtly and in delicate 	poetry---
unable to get off in any other way; but, delicate reader, rest assured, I never torture dogs.  I really 	love dogs.  I am a dog who deserves to be flogged, or so this dog's Master tells him every 	second Tuesday;
and if you are offended by this, bigots, I will appease you: for my mother always said "what we 	do in the bedroom ought to stay in the bedroom," and I love my mother too, and I find it 	so garish when people intimate the intimates; so I instead lament, and bitch, and moan
and secretly brag about how much harm I've done myself, what black depths of depression and 	of drug use; of abusive relationships and apathy and all the manner of sophisticated, brooding emotions.

But now it has neutered itself
